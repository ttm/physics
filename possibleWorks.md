# Ideas for contributions
- Ontologies for physics domains (quantum, relativity etc)
- Use of physical laws and specific settings to generate music, images and animations
- Present (Python) implementations of theories or problems
- Develop rate of change of acceleraion into classical mechanics and relativity.
For example: if a body starts from rest and starts its movement towards
another body by means of the gravitational force, the acceleration increases
as the bodies gets closer together. Is this rate of change of acceleration in anyway
constant? Might it be easely related to the energy of the bodies (mass) and how
would it be affected when nearing the speed of light?
What are the Lagrangian and Hamiltonian representations of these issues?
Are there any implication to quantum level phenomena?

And Jounce (derivative of Jerk).
Further notes: 
  * as an object is subjected to the gravitational force,
its speed increases and therefore its energy and thus its mass.
As its mass increases, the force increases.
  * The other object is also submitted to the force (but in opposite direction)
  and thus it also moves to the first object. As is gets closer, the gravitational force increases.
- Observe the universe as a computation capable (or oriented) system. Do this by tackling physical laws
and how they might serve the purpose of computing / processing information.
