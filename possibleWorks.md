# Ideas for contributions
- Ontologies for physics domains (quantum, relativity etc)
- Use of physical laws and specific settings to generate music, images and animations
- Present (Python) implementations of theories or problems:
  * they should expose the theory in a clear manner (such as done with MASSA).
  * They might be linked to the Ontologies for enabling machines not only to navigate data and concepts,
  but also derive results from the theories.
- Develop rate of change of acceleration into classical mechanics and relativity.
For example: if a body starts from rest and starts its movement towards
another body by means of the gravitational force, the acceleration increases
as the bodies gets closer together. Is this rate of change of acceleration in anyway
constant? Might it be easily related to the energy of the bodies (mass) and how
would it be affected when nearing the speed of light?
What are the Lagrangian and Hamiltonian representations of these issues?
Are there any implication to quantum level phenomena?

Further notes: 
  * as an object is subjected to the gravitational force,
its speed increases and therefore its energy and thus its mass.
As its mass increases, the force increases.
  * The other object is also submitted to the force (but in opposite direction)
  and thus it also moves to the first object. As is gets closer, the gravitational force increases.
- Observe the universe as a computation capable (or oriented) system. Do this by tackling physical laws
and how they might serve the purpose of computing / processing information.
- Quantum mechanics and relativity are both dependent on the observant.
Model reality as a computational device of observers.
Each observant processes information in a network dependent on itself
and a network composed of other individuals, concepts and concomitant in time and space with other entities (including observers).
Try to derive physical laws from this framework or vice-versa.
Or state that one cannot be true if the other is not true.
Link the framework to the stationary action principle, for example.
- Collapse space from:
  * The fact that light takes no time to go from x to y.
  * Gravity being a force in both sources, their masses increased as speed increases, the force increases as the sources nears each other.
  There then should be feedback mechanisms into the force which co
- A procedural method for finding Schur sets (inspired by change ringing?):

- Include the stationary action principle to the ubiquity of inequality paper.
Find the Lagrangian that is being minemized.
If we have the Hamiltonian, we can relate the power-law to energy, but what would be
the p.q' terms?
- Describe physics laws from other relations of propelling and motion than F=ma.
This should illustrate the fact that the acceleration (and the force) are *arbitrary* conventions
for establishing relations of physical phenomena and motion.
