- Coursera, edX and Susskind courses
- Penrose and Tsallis books
- Mumford's Pattern Theory
- Scientific articles upon need
- Feynman lectures

## strategies
- Notes on studied topics
- Notes on ideas to write about
- Tackle mathematics as they appear
- Derive or take advantage of computational models
- Find a way to make exercises (look for them in the web and books)
- Look for the contribution of recent Nobel prizes
- Dig into recent article and software publications 

## questions
- how does the constant speed of light arise from Maxwell's equations?
- how to intuitively interpret the Lagrangian and Hamiltonians?
- to which extent the quantum theories acknowledge the collapse of a wave function to a particle?
- to which extent do nowadays physics acknowledge that there might be no time and space because for the light itself it takes no time to travel?
